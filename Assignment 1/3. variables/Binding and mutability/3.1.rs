fn main() {

    assert_eq!(x, 5);

}

assert_eq() is generaly used to test an assumption
 here it is x equal to 5. This throws an error because x unassignend.
To clear the error we can just assign 5 to x.

//solution


fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 5; // Uninitialized but used, ERROR !
    let y: i32; // Uninitialized but also unused, only a Warning !

    assert_eq!(x, 5);
    println!("Success!");
